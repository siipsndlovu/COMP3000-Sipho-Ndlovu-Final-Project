# Complete Fitness

This application was deigned to be fitness application for the average persoon by providing a daily meal/workout planner. Unfortunately, this wasn't quite possible due to poor time management.


## Disclaimer

Currently only the Registration/login is working fully with account initialisation partialy working. In order to ensure the program works when the repo is cloned, the SQL script within the "MySQL_sever" folder has to be ran within MySQL_workbench. You will also need to use the terminal within VS code to change to the "server" directory and run the following command node app.mjs, this requires the installation of Node.js. The "ngrok http 5000" command will also need to be ran. You will then need to type "http://localhost:4040" and copy and paste the Http URL given as the new link from this code:
"const API_URL = 'http://d3ee-82-44-28-144.ngrok.io';". Finaly you need to make sure your VScode environment has React Native Expo set up, You can then  run this application by running the "npm start" command!
